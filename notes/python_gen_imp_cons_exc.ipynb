    "Generators are data structures similar to lists with the difference that in memory it does not hold all the values of the list, but instead, the computer code needed to well.. generate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we have not emphasized it, the `range` , `enumerate` , `items` , `map` that we have presented before, in essense, return a generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand generators let's use a real life example. Suppose someone tells you: memorize the following 100 phone numbers in that given order. After that, say the first number, then the second, etc ..\n",
    "\n",
    "This would require a lot of effort (and memory) from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose now that someone tells you: memorize all even numbers from 2 to 1000. After that tell me the first then the second, etc ..\n",
    "\n",
    "No special effort is required for this. You just have to remember the logic in order to get the next number in this sequence. This is exactly what generators do. They are useful in cases where the next item in a list can be computed and not recalled from memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "So with the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "range(1,100_000_000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no reason to store 100,000,000 values in computer memory. Let's see it in practice. If we run:\n",

    "![](https://i.imgur.com/ET60jB8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that python needs 1.5GB of memory. If we need to get arbitrary values from list `a` then we can not do otherwise. Otherwise if we just need to get one value after another then we can save this memory by writing:\n",

    "So far we have seen how to make incredible things on Jupyter. Jupyter has recently emerged as a means of writing code but also as a method of sharing our programs. Jupyter is **not** the norm for creating programs with python but rather the exception. Most programs are written in `.py` files, for example `program.py` . We `run` these programs from the command line with the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python program.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is the command line?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each computer, regardless of operating system (windows, osx, Linux) has a program called [the command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). When you open this program a console appears where the user can type commands and by pressing the Enter button, the computer executes them (or otherwise \"runs\" them). It may sound strange today but this is also the main way with which most programs run on your computer. When you double-click to open a program in a graphical environment, the computer internally simply executes the corresponding program command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following: Graphic environments (eg. windows) have been around since the 1990s. How did people work on computers before? Answer: By writing commands on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following: Jupyter has been around since 2014 (and IPython, on which it has been based since 2001). RStudio has been around since 2010. How did people work in these popular languages before? Answer: With the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this: A program that requires a supercomputer to run on a remote machine and takes months to complete, how do we submit it for execution? We certainly can not have a jupyter open for months! The answer is we submit it through the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following: In orer for a program to run requires the user to provide a number of input parameters. For example the location of the file containing my measurements. How do we \"instruct\" the program to use \"this\" file? Answer: With the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line is the \"classic\" and timeless interface through which we interact with the computer. Computers and operating systems are built with this philosophy: The user will send me commands and I will execute them. Graphics systems came after and work \"above\" this logic.\n"

In this way students can directly practice programming in a familiar environment such as the browser.
